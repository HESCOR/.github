# HESCOR — Human & Earth System Coupled Research

HESCOR (Human & Earth System Coupled Research) is an interdisciplinary research initiative at the **University of Cologne** that brings together Earth system science, human system modelling, and the humanities to study how interactions between **nature and culture** have shaped—and continue to shape—our world.

## What we do

HESCOR combines paleoclimate/environmental reconstructions, archaeological evidence, and modern computational methods (including machine learning) to address questions such as:

- How have climatic shifts influenced human cultural evolution?
- How do human decisions and societal change impact the Earth system?
- How can computational tools help unlock the past?

The research network is structured around **ten thematic Work Packages (WPs)** spanning theory, climate modelling, dispersal/network approaches, archaeological databases, and ML-based cultural analyses.

## Repositories

This GitHub organization serves as a **curated entry point** to HESCOR-related code and infrastructure.

> Important: Many research outputs are intentionally hosted in **member-owned repositories** (to keep ownership, governance, and long-term URLs stable).  
> This list is here to improve visibility and discovery.

### Research software

- **PaleoVeg** — Python package for paleovegetation reconstruction (predicting vegetation/biome types from bioclimatic variables; includes optional C3/C4 competition corrections).  
  Repo: https://github.com/roink/PaleoVeg

- **Green Wave** — Research codebase for reconstructing vegetation phenology and “green waves” using satellite vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI), orbital/insolation forcing, and paleoclimate reconstructions, with links to questions around human mobility and settlement dynamics.  
  Repo: https://github.com/roink/green_wave

### Data infrastructure

- **ckan-docker (HESCOR fork)** — Docker Compose-based CKAN deployment setup, used as the basis for our CKAN-backed data portal/database work.  
  Repo: https://github.com/roink/ckan-docker

### Project tools

- **survey123_to_pdf** — Command-line workflow to turn a Survey123 CSV export into per-response A4 PDF summaries (grouping repeated blocks and skipping unanswered questions).  
  Repo: https://github.com/roink/survey123_to_pdf
